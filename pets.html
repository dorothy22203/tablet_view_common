                <p>Maui is a two-year-old mini-doodle who thinks he is as big as a German shepherd. This mindset allows him to voice his opinion, especially when demanding food or attention. He is also a classic momma's boy, as he has learned if he is annoying enough, he can get anything he demands. </p>
                <p>During his lounging time, he gets to the highest chair he can get on and stares outside, waiting either for guests or belly rubs. He also has the tendency to force his mother to go to sleep as soon as his father goes to bed.</p>

        <h2>Jojo</h2>
        <img src = "images/jojo.jpg" width = "400" alt="White/light brown small Lhasa-Apso">


        <p>Jojo is a 14 year old dog that has grown up with me. He&#39;s a Lhasa-Apso which is a breed from Tibet that&#39;s known to be a watchdog. Funny enough, Jojo acts exactly like a watchdog. He likes to spend his days sitting next to a window looking and barking at people passing by. He is only a watchdog though, as he gets scared very easily.</p>
        <p>His favorite thing in life is food and his favorite foods are sweet potatoes and naan. He loves walks as well, however he will not go outside if it&#39;s raining or if there&#39;s a lot of snow on the ground. He&#39;s taken some old blankets and pillows we had to make his own bed. He&#39;s also trilingual, able to understand English, Hindi, and Japanese.</p>
